How the program works:

Our program works by taking in input from the user and tokenizing it. It takes these tokens and checks for our hard-coded functions (cd, pwd, exit), if those are found, it runs the appropriate code. If none of those are found, the file then checks to see if what was given is a runnable function and if there are < or > present. It then runs given code inside a child process (if possible) and sets output/input streams as neccessary. It continuously does this until "exit" is given from the user. All functions are inside "functions.c" and "techshell.c" is used to call said functions as needed and drive the main loop. The Makefile is used to compile, run, and clean uneeded files to make running the code much simpler.
